Nancy started her fourteenth reincarnation feeling smaller than she ever had before. Thirteen had ended poorly, so the name of the game for this life would be revenge.

Sweet, bloody revenge.

Starting over is never easy. Issues such as lost resources, severed relationships, and waking up in a crib, tend to make getting back to a life of mass murder difficult. So until the time was right, Nancy would plan the best method to kill Gary Whitehem, the sheriff of Clinton, South Carolina who shot her while she was peeling the face off a bank teller.

On the plus side, since she was unable to speak, rollover, or do anything except lay on her stomach in the crib, she had plenty of time to think back through her greatest hits and find the perfect punishment from Sheriff Whitehem. It would have to suffice until she re-learned to walk, run, and use a fillet knife.

Nancy had always been a sucker for the classics. No need for elaborate schemes or tools to make the blood flow. Afterall, the tried and true methods were tried and true for a reason, right?

Some of her most exciting experiences had come from simple play-dates with people tied to a chair while she slowly drug knives across their bodies. Seeing skin slowly separate, exposing the red meat contained within, was the ultimate high. Knowing you were in complete control over someone else's body and you were free to do as you wanted was a feeling that could not be topped.

Nancy savored this thought, knowing she would experience the high again when she slowly pulled a serrated steak knife back and forth over Sheriff Whitehem's tongue.

She only hoped if he somehow managed to kill her again, that reincarnation fifteen would be different from this one and she wouldn't come back as a doll.
